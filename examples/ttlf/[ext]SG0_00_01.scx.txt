Name: Mayuri
Character Line: “Are you okay?! Hang in there! Don’t die...!”

Name: Suzuha
Character Line: “He’s okay. It’s not his blood.”

Name: Rintaro
Character Line: “There’s no way to save her... there never was...”

Name: Rintaro
Character Line: “Hahaha... Everything has already been decided...”

Name: Rintaro
Character Line: “It’s the same as it was with Mayuri. The same...”

Name: Rintaro
Character Line: “No matter how hard I struggle... the result will always be the same...”

Name: Rintaro
Character Line: “There’s nothing I can do... nothing... nothing...”

Name: Suzuha
Character Line: “He k-killed Makise Kurisu.”

Name: Mayuri
Character Line: “Killed? That can’t be true... It can’t...”

Name: Suzuha

Name: Rintaro
Character Line: “There’s just no way to save Kurisu! You can’t stop the [color index="280AA02D1400"]world line[color index="800000"] convergence...”

Name: Suzuha
Character Line: “Grr...! I’ll just have to slap some sense into him—”

Name: Mayuri
Character Line: “You can’t! It’s not right to force him to do this...!”

Name: Mayuri
Character Line: “I can’t bear to see Okarin like this...”

Name: Suzuha
Character Line: “If he doesn’t, the future won’t change!”

Name: Mayuri
Character Line: “Why? Why does Okarin have to change the future all by himself?!”

Name: Mayuri
Character Line: “That’s too much for him to bear...”

Name: Suzuha
Character Line: “Because only Uncle Okarin has the powers of an observer of the world.”

Name: Mayuri
Character Line: “Okarin didn’t want that!”

Name: Mayuri
Character Line: “And I think even if he tried, he’d just get hurt again...”

Name: Suzuha
Character Line: “I can’t go back to 2036 either way, so I’m not going to give up so easily.”

Name: Mayuri
Character Line: “...”

Name: Suzuha
Character Line: “Uncle Okarin, I’ll tell you one thing. This time machine has a finite amount of fuel.”

Name: Suzuha
Character Line: “At first, I told you that it could only be used to go there and back twice, but there’s actually a little more fuel than that.”

Name: Suzuha
Character Line: “Even so, it can only travel about 344 days.”

Name: Suzuha
Character Line: “Even if you do a one-way trip, less than a year from now you won’t be able to reach July 28th.”

Name: Suzuha
Character Line: “Remember this. When that day comes, I’ll go myself if I must.”

Name: Rintaro
Character Line: “...”

Name: Mayuri
Character Line: “Okarin?”

Name: Mayuri
Character Line: “Okarin... Hey, Okarin...”

Name: Mayuri
Character Line: “You don’t have to push yourself so hard anymore, okay?”

Name: Mayuri
Character Line: “It’s okay to cry, Okarin...”

Name: Mayuri
